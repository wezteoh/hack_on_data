      "['edit: WARNING, they have changed sellers on this item.  When I bought mine, the seller was \"Gimika\".  As of this edit (March 15, 2014), the most recent reviews still seem positive, so it\\'s probably still okay.  But double check to be sure, especially if it\\'s May 2014 or later.Original review: There are many many wireless receivers on the market, but many of them require you to do surgery to get the drivers installed, as they do not have the correct (Microsoft) USB IDs for the official drivers to recognize them.  You have to either edit the driver files, or force-load them, and the whole process is a big pain in the butt.This offering does it correctly.  You just plug it in, and if you\\'re on Win 7 or later, the drivers automatically install, no hassle.  If you\\'re on XP, there\\'s a driver disk included.  After it\\'s connected and the drivers have installed themselves, you just press the \\'introduction\\' button on both the receiver and the controller, and wham, it\\'s operational.  No fuss, no muss, things just work.I don\\'t know with certainty that this receiver is actually made by Microsoft.  It could still be a fake.  But, if so, at least it\\'s a *good* fake, coming with the right USB IDs, and a driver disk that certainly looks genuine.There\\'s no hassle, the price is reasonable, and the seller seems good.  If you\\'re going to buy a wireless receiver, this is probably the one you want.\\n\\n', \"This game a great idea in theory, but the control is so painful that most of the fun is sucked right out.  Instead of being sensible and using either the buttons or the D-pad to move your character around, they both move the view, and you have to click on the screen to move your character.  This means you will, very frequently, miss something you're trying to click on.  Since you're often clicking in a great hurry before you get eaten by a ravenous beast, running over to it is not conducive to continued good health.Further, the objects are really too big for the tiny screen, and can be very hard to move where you want.  Further still, they use weird words for stuff... a 'bridge' conjures a short and fairly useless piece of wood, but a 'bridge ladder' will conjure a very long flat piece, perfect for crossing water or the like.  'Bridge ladder' isn't exactly a normal vocabulary word.  The only way to find this out, other than reading reviews, is by carefully inspecting new levels as you arrive and noting down names of useful items for later.This is a super innovative idea, and I wanted very much to love this game, but in actual fact I got annoyed with it and stopped playing.\\n\\n\", \"Saeth left a review that covers the enormous problems with the ending to this game, and I agree almost completely with everything he or she said.I further wanted to add that, while a lot of people are saying that Bioware should do a new ending, I don't think it will fix anything.  Personally, I would never believe a new ending.  Problem is, I don't believe the old ending, either.  My suspension of disbelief for the entire Mass Effect universe is shattered, in tiny shards on the floor.  All things my Shepard did, all the people he helped (or that my Renegade Femshep cheerfully screwed over)... none of those things mattered in the least, at the end.SPOILERS FOLLOW:If you're a prior player of this series, whatever you did in Mass Effect 1 and 2, no matter what course you charted, you will get the exact same ending I did.  Everyone you liked, everyone you hated, all the cultures, all the planets, everything?  They're all destroyed, wiped out in exploding Mass Relays (and we know from the DLC in ME2 just how cataclysmic a collapsing relay is, from a simple rock hitting it, nevermind the most powerful weapon ever designed by the Galaxy's second most advanced race).  Your sole choice is red, green, or blue fire to wipe them out with.That's it.  That's what all your choices amount to: nothing.  No matter how skilled you were, no matter how inept you were, no matter how carefully you guided your decision-making, no matter how sloppy and uncaring you were, the ultimate choice is the same: kill everyone and everything you know, with one of three festive colors.This must be the worst big-budget storytelling failure, like, *ever*.  The midpoints of the game are awesome, but the end is so appallingly terrible that it retroactively poisoned any happy memories I had of everything else I'd seen and done, all through the entire series.  Not even the Matrix was this bad, and I certainly didn't invest $160 and a hundred and fifty hours battling through the three Matrix movies.\\n\\n\", \"This is one of the best titles on the PS3, and will, I think, be long-remembered.  What's stuck with me, more than anything else, is the voicing.  The actors were cast and directed with consummate skill; Ellie was particularly excellent.  It's hard to give examples of spoken dialogue in a written review, but in my second playthrough, I found a little optional conversation I'd missed the first time, where she reads out of a joke book she found.  Her slightly-stumbling delivery was just so good, especially when she messed one of the jokes up, and had to repeat it.  I'm no expert on voice acting, but I don't think I've ever heard anyone be that convincing at getting something *wrong*.  That tiny little vignette might be my favorite spoken bit in a video game, ever, simply because it feels so human.As video game stories go, this is about as good as it gets, and it's better than many, many movies I've seen.The game itself is kinda-sorta survival horror, although it's not monster-closet scary, it's just a dreary world with very dangerous enemies.  In some games, you slaughter baddies by the hundreds, but most of the time in The Last of Us, you're thinking about just one at a time.  Getting jumped by several at once is really, really dangerous.  It's still videogamey, in that you can survive being shot multiple times, and then return to full health with a simple medpak, but they are not common.  Everything is scarce, all the time.  Combat is probably going to kill you repeatedly, even on Normal difficulty, until you learn what's going on.... and maybe afterward, too.  If you're not good at games, you'll probably want to play on Easy.This game is hard, it's very very tense in spots, and it pulls few punches, getting downright brutal in places.  It goes where video games very rarely go.Overall, The Last of Us is a masterpiece, one that gets few things wrong, and a tremendous number of things exactly right.  I had a hell of a great time, and if you're willing to play difficult games, I recommend it as strongly as I possibly can.\\n\\n\", 'Fundamentally, SimCity has always been a \\'software toy\\'.  That means that there\\'s no real end state, no way to win.  It\\'s just a thing that you play and experiment with.  You build, and tinker, and mess around.  It\\'s a toy, not a game; it\\'s a sandbox, not baseball.So, in this iteration of the game, you don\\'t even get to buy your toy.  Rather, you rent a toy from EA, who lets you play with it only in very limited, circumscribed ways, only on their servers.  So you have to have a live Internet connection at all times, and their servers have to be up, and have to have space for you.  And the rules for play are draconian.  If you want to, say, build a city, save it, blow it up with something terrible, and then restore from save, you can\\'t do that anymore.  That\\'s an unauthorized usage of their toy. And if you figure out ways of using their toy that they don\\'t like, they\\'ll ban you forever.All third-party modding is shut out.  One of the best parts of SimCity 4 and The Sims is that users can create and share content among themselves for free.  You will no longer be able to do this.  You will be required to run only Official Authorized Content.Further, you\\'re not getting the whole game for your $60 or $80, depending on what version you\\'re buying.  EA\\'s plan is to sell you Simcity 5 over and over and over.  They\\'ve directly admitted that they already have it running with larger cities, but they\\'re not releasing that now.  They claim it\\'s because it \"won\\'t run on Dad\\'s PC\", but the real reason is so they can sell it to you again later.  Want subways?  That\\'s gonna be $20.  Want railroads?  Another $20.  Bigger cities?  Oh, that\\'s in the $30 expansion.Right now, if you look at The Sims 3, the game costs $30.  But if also you buy all the DLC for it, it\\'s *four hundred and seventy dollars*.  This is what they are doing with SimCity 5; locking you into their server infrastructure, and then exploiting the heck out of your wallet.This is a lousy deal, and you would be stupid to take it.  Always-on DRM, and a deliberately crippled game, so that they can slowly uncripple it, charging you for every restored feature from prior versions.Simcity 4 still works pretty well.  It\\'s not quite as nice as most current games, and can require you to \\'pin\\' the process to just one processor on a multi-core system (ie, most current machines), but if you want a city builder where you won\\'t have to pay extra to breathe both in AND out, that would be a better option.But buying this game?  In my opinion, you would be wiser to take three twenties out of your wallet, and light them on fire.\\n\\n']\n"
